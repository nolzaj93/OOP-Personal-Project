Applying concepts learned in the Oracle iLearning AI with Machine Learning Course

#### Week 1 - Section 1 Introduction 2 hours
- Read through 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
##### Key Points
- Goal of AI is building machines to behave intelligently
- Turing Test: if an observer of a conversation between a computer and a human cannot differentiate which one is human, then the computer passes the test.
- Artificial Intelligence: attempt to build machines capable of simulating intelligent human behavior.
- AI machines are built through the use of Machine Learning (focus of this course) or with other approaches, like Deep Learning
- Machine learning: science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed - Stanford University.
- ML programs aim to gain information that can be used against another similar problem.
- wiki definition- machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data.
-Applications of AI and ML: face identification, Facebook advertisements, Netflix personalized suggestion, Amazon purchase suggestions.

Task - 3 scenarios that use Machine Learning
- Speech-to-text saves time typing
- Face detection/recognition improves security, reduces crime.
- GPS can avoid time spent in traffic

- Others -Virtual Personal Assistants, Video Surveillance, Online Fraud Detection, Healthcare, Financial Trading, Smart Cars

##### Data Exhaust
- Trails of data you leave behind which constantly gives you information throughout the day
- The data from users is what is feeding the growth of Machine Learning
